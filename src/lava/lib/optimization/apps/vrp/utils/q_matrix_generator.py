        None-type will raise an exception asking for the correct problem
        type to be specified. The matrix Q is considered to have all-to-all
        connectivity between the nodes that are specified.

        Args:
            input_nodes (list<tuples>): Input to matrix generator functions
            containing a list of nodes specified as tuples.

            num_vehicles (int): Number of vehicles in the Vehicle Routing
            Problem. The first `num_vehicles` nodes in the `input_nodes`
            variable correspond to positions of vehicles and the rest
            waypoints. Defaults to 1

            problem_type (str, optional): Specifies for the type of problem
            for which Q matrix has to be generated. Currently support for
            1. `tsp` : Travelling salesman problem
            2. `clustering` : Clustering problem framed as a QUBO. Defaults
            to 'None'.

            lamda_wypts (float, optional): penalty term for the wypt nodes
            in the Q matrix generator for clustering.

            lamda_vhcles (float, optional): penalty term for the vhcle nodes
            in the Q matrix generator for clustering

            lamda_dist (float, optional): penalty term for the distances
            between nodes in the Q matrix generator.

            lamda_cnstrt (float, optional): penalty term for the constraint
            between nodes in the Q matrix generator for tsp problem. This
            also corresponds to the unweighted part of the tsp problem.

            fixed_pt (bool, optional): Specifies if the Q matrix should
            ultimately be rounded down to integer. If `True`, stochastic
            rounding to integer range of Loihi 2 is performed. Defaults to
            `False`.

            fixed_pt_range (tuple<int>, optional): Specifies the absolute
            value of  min and max values that the Q matrix can have if
            `fixed_pt =True`.

            clust_dist_sparse_params (dict, optional) : Dictionary of
            parameters for sparsification of the distance matrix used in
            clustering of the waypoint and the vehicle positions. The
            parameters are:
                - do_sparse (bool) : a toggle to enable/disable sparsification
                (default is False, i.e., disable sparsification)
                - algo (string) : the algorithm used for sparsification (
                default is "cutoff", which imposes a maximum cutoff distance
                on the distance matrix and subtracts it from the matrix.
                Another option is "edge-prune", which prunes edges longer
                than a cutoff from the connectivity graph of the entire problem
                - max_dist_cutoff_fraction (float) : a fraction between 0 and 1,
                which multiplies the max of the distance matrix, and the
                result is used as the cutoff in both algorithms.

            profile_mat_gen (bool, optional): Specifies if Q matrix
            generation needs to be timed using python's time.time()
