    Parameters
    ----------
    shape: a tuple of the form (number of variables, domain size).
    step_size: The coefficient of the variables indicating their relative
        linear contribution to the cost function. Usually corresponds to the
        linear term or the diagonal of the quadratic term on the cost function.
    cost_diagonal: The diagonal of the coefficient of the quadratic term on the
        cost function.
    name: Name of the Process. Default is 'Process_ID', where ID is an
        integer value that is determined automatically.
    log_config: Configuration options for logging.z


    Attributes
    ----------
    a_in: InPort
        The addition of all inputs (per dynamical system) at this timestep

    s_out: OutPort
        The payload to be exchanged between the underlying dynamical systems
        when these fire.
    local_cost: OutPort
        The cost components per dynamical system underlying these
        variables, i.e., c_i = sum_j{Q_{ij} \cdot x_i}  will be sent through
        this port. The cost integrator will then complete the cost computation
        by adding all contributions, i.e., x^T \cdot Q \cdot x = sum_i{c_i}.
    variable_assignment: Var
        Holds the current value assigned to the variables by
        the solver network.

class StochasticIntegrateAndFire(AbstractProcess):

    The main output is intended as input to other dynamical systems on
    the network, whilst the second output is to transfer local information to be
    integrated by an auxiliary dynamical system or circuit.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape: The shape of the set of dynamical systems to be created.
    init_state: The starting value of the state variable.
    step_size: a value to be added to the state variable at each timestep.
    noise_amplitude: The width/range for the stochastic perturbation to the
    state variable. A random number within this range will be added to the
    state variable at each timestep.
    input_duration: Number of timesteps by which each input should be preserved.
    min_state: The minimum value for the state variable. The state variable
    will be truncated at this value if updating results in a lower value.
    min_integration: The minimum value for the total input (addition of all
    valid inputs at a given timestep). The total input value will be truncated
    at this value if adding current and preserved inputs results in a lower
    value.
    steps_to_fire: After how many timesteps would the dynamical system fire
    and reset without stochastic perturbation. Note that if noise_amplitude > 0,
    the system will stochastically deviate from this value.
    refractory_period: number of timesteps to wait after firing and reset before
    resuming updating.
    cost_diagonal: The linear coefficients on the cost function of the
    optimization problem where this system will be used.
    name: Name of the Process. Default is 'Process_ID', where ID is an
    integer value that is determined automatically.
    log_config: Configuration options for logging.

    Attributes
    ----------
    added_input: InPort
        The addition of all inputs (per dynamical system) at this
        timestep will be received by this port.
    replace_assignment: InPort
        Todo: deprecate
    messages: OutPort
        The payload to be sent to other dynamical systems when firing.
    local_cost: OutPort
        the cost component corresponding to this dynamical system, i.e.,
        c_i = sum_j{Q_{ij} \cdot x_i}  will be sent through this port. The cost
        integrator will then complete the cost computation  by adding all
        contributions, i.e., x^T \cdot Q \cdot x = sum_i{c_i}.
