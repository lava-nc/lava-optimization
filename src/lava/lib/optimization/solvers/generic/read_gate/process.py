class ReadGate(AbstractProcess):
    """Process that triggers solution readout when problem is solved.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape: The shape of the set of units in the downstream process whose state
        will be read by ReadGate.
    target_cost: cost value at which, once attained by the network,
        this process will stop execution.
    name: Name of the Process. Default is 'Process_ID', where ID is an
        integer value that is determined automatically.
    log_config: Configuration options for logging.

    InPorts
    -------
    cost_in_last_bytes: OutPort
        Receives a better cost found by the CostIntegrator at the
        previous timestep.
        Messages the last 3 byte of the new best cost.
        Total cost = cost_in_first_byte << 24 + cost_in_last_bytes.
    cost_in_first_byte: OutPort
        Receives a better cost found by the CostIntegrator at the
        previous timestep.
        Messages the first byte of the new best cost.

    OutPorts
    --------
    cost_out: Forwards to an upstream process the better cost notified by the
        CostIntegrator.
    solution_out: Forwards to an upstream process the better variable assignment
        found by the solver network.
    send_pause_request: Notifies upstream process to request execution to pause.
