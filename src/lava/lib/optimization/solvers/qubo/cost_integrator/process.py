class CostIntegrator(AbstractProcess):
    """Node that monitors execution of the QUBOSolver. It integrates the cost
    components from all variables. Whenever a new better solution is found,
    it stores the new best cost and the associated timestep, while triggering
    the variable neurons to store the new best state. Waits for stopping
    criteria to be reached, either target_cost or timeout. Once reached,
    it spikes out the best cost, timestep, and a trigger for the variable
    neurons to spike out the best state.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape : tuple(int)
        The expected number and topology of the input cost components.
    target_cost: int
        Target cost of the QUBO solver. Once reached, the best_cost,
        best_timestep, and best_variable_assignment are spiked out.
    timeout: int
        Timeout of the QUBO solver. Once reached, the best_cost,
        best_timestep, and best_variable_assignment are spiked out.
    name : str, optional
        Name of the Process. Default is 'Process_ID', where ID is an
        integer value that is determined automatically.
        log_config: Configuration options for logging.

    InPorts
    -------
    cost_in
        input from the variable neurons. Added, this input denotes
        the total cost of the current variable assignment.

    OutPorts
    --------
    control_states_out
        Port to the variable neurons.
        Can send either of the following three values:
            1 -> store the state, since it is the new best state
            2 -> store the state and spike it, since stopping criteria reached
            3 -> spike the best state
    best_cost_out
        Port to the SolutionReadout. Sends the best cost found.
    best_timestep_out
        Port to the SolutionReadout. Sends the timestep when the best cost
        was found.

    Vars
    ----
    timestep
        Holds current timestep
    cost_min_last_bytes
        Current minimum cost, i.e., the lowest reported cost so far.
        Saves the last 3 bytes.
        cost_min = cost_min_first_byte << 24 + cost_min_last_bytes
    cost_min_first_byte
        Current minimum cost, i.e., the lowest reported cost so far.
        Saves the first byte.
    cost_last_bytes
        Current cost.
        Saves the last 3 bytes.
        cost_min = cost_min_first_byte << 24 + cost_min_last_bytes
    cost_first_byte
        Current cost.
        Saves the first byte.
