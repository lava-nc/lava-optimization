    "# Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) with Lava\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial ramps up users who want to use Lava's solver for quadratic unconstraint binary optimization (QUBO) problems. It starts with an intuitive description of the algorithm behind the solver, before it explains how to generally encode and solve arbitrary QUBO workloads on CPU and Loihi2. As example application, we will apply the solver to search for the the maximum independent set of a graph. An outlook will finally give a glimpse into the future features of the Lava solver that will be enabled in later software releases. \n",

    "- Improved solver performance, e.g., by stochastic noise levels that progressively decrease. \n",
    "- New solver algorithms in Lava, like simulated annealing, that exploit the general-purpose programmable neurons available in Loihi2.\n",
    "- Higher compilation speed. While neuromorphic hardware is fast at solving optimization problems, the time it takes to write the problem to Loihi will be substantially accelerated in the near term.\n",
    "- Added compiler support for larger problem sizes.\n",
    "- Automatic hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "- More stopping criteria besides a target cost and solver iterations, such as convergence of the solver.\n",
    "- Utilities that allow an easy benchmarking between Loihi1, Loihi2, and CPU-based state-of-the-art solvers. <br> Benchmarking metrics will include solution accuracy, speed, and energy efficiency.\n",
