    "# Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) with Lava\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous work, we found that our first generation Loihi 1 chip can solve QUBOs more than 17x faster and more than 670x more energy efficient than the CPU-based solver QBSolv [1], which \"executes in two-thirds of the time of the best previously known implementation\" [2]. Lava translates this solver to Loihi 2 to exploit this chip's higher speed, efficiency, and new hardware features designed for optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial ramps up users who want to use Lava's solver for quadratic unconstraint binary optimization (QUBO) problems. It starts with an intuitive description of the algorithm behind the solver, before it exemplifies how to encode and solve a QUBO workload with 700 variables on CPU and Loihi2. An outlook will finally give a glimpse into the future feature releases of the Lava solver. \n",

If two vias cannot be simultaneously replaced by double vias due to design rule violations, their vertices are connected by an edge.
